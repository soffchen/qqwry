0.1.2	2006-5-19
	* Following changes all contributed by Guenter Knauf
- moved argument parsing up at various places before we create a GeoIP.
- moved GeoIP_delete() call at various places up to get it called before we error out.
- fixed one place where a missing return caused a segfault on all platforms because
  RETURN_STRING() was called with NULL when GeoIP lookup failed.
- added php.ini entry parsing; prepared for usage of geoip.database_standard var.
  This works fine so far as you can test with the geoip_database_info() call which uses
  the database configured with the geoip.database_standard var; if not set it defaults
  to the usual place specified during compile time with GEOIPDATADIR. All other functions
  currently still ignore the geoip.database_standard setting, but default usually also
  to GEOIPDATADIR from what I see. Search for the dirty '//' comments ....
